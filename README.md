##Â  The FrAmE framework

This project is the collaboration of [Zlatan](https://github.com/zlayabekrija) & [Inzi](https://github.com/inhaq).

To enhance and practice our CSS3 knowledge, we made our own full fledged CSS based framework .

We created the responsive navbars and forms with 768 px breakpoint .

Colums were made by Flex Display with 12 coulmn based grid with respective sizes of columns.

Classes were made for utilities :

-   Margins
    
-   Paddings
    
-   Borders
    
-   Display
    
-   Text
    
-   Flex box
